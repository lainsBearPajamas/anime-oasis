    <h2> 
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      Imagine a world in which humanity as we know it has collapsed and some remaining humans have moved to Mars to build a futuristic city of water and sky there. Well, that's Aria pretty much. Although it may seem gloomy and sci-fi enough from the description, it is actually neither. Well, what is Aria?
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images-aria/Aria-intro.jpg" alt="" class="overview-image">
      <div class="image-subtitles">
        Aria is actually a really relaxing show
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Setting
    </h2>
    <p> 
      The world of Aria takes place in the early 24th century Mars now called Aqua. In this world Mars has been terraformed and filled with water and given an atmosphere so that humans could live there. Earth has become a shadow of what it used to be and is called here Manhome. On this planet exists a big city called Neo-Venetia.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of, the city is of course a reference to our real Venetia on Manhome. Neo-Venetia was built as a monument that is supposed to be a copy of the city that went underwater and was lost to time. You can find a lot of glorious landscapes, wind turbines, bridges, and beautiful monuments of Venetian architecture in Neo-Venetia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, of course this wonderful city wouldn't exist without the humans living there. Aria is a show about undines - water guides of this city. They operate beautiful gondolas and tell people the history of Neo-Venetia, as well as take them to the beautiful places of this city.  
    </p>

    <h2>
      Plot
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although the city of Neo-Venetia surely has many interesting stories to tell, Aria is not really a show that could be called plot-driven. The main idea of this show is to relax and enchant the viewer with the majestic and wondrous atmosphere this world has to provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first season we are introduced to Akari who flies from Manhome to become an undine at Aria Company. Then we gradually get introduced to her colleagues and their own mentors. We also learn about the different sorts of jobs necessary for their city's existence like the gnomes manipulating the gravity or the Salamanders manipulating the weather from Ukijima the flying island. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In it's essence Aria is a show about how time inevitably changes. It is built upon the Japanese phenomenon of Mono no Aware or Enchantment of the Present. We get to see how girls change, grow up, and become more mature and professional. We also get to see them exploring the secrets of this city, as well as themselves. However, Neo-Venetia never changes and remains just the same beautiful and kind city it is from the start of the series. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Characters 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aria is of course a slice-of-life show that relies quite a bit on it's characters to be interesting to watch. Luckily, the characters of this show are all quite memorable people each in their own way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, we have the trio of girls who act as main characters: Aika, Akari, and Alice. Aika is hardworking and honest but somewhat proud of herself and maybe a bit too jealous of Akari's mentor. Akari is a dreamer girl who sees the world in much brighter colors than other people do. She makes Aria what it is. Alicia is a socially anxious but incredibly gifted girl who complements the trio in a nice way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, we have the mentors of the main trio: Alicia, Akira, and Athena. By the way, have you noticed all names in this show start with 'A'? Alicia is very kind and generous but maybe sometimes a bit too allowing, Akira is very strong-willed and professional but sometimes too strict to the girls, and Athena is kind in her own sweet way towards Alice but comically inattentive and makes a lot of mistakes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have the side characters: Ai, Akino, Akatsuki, Al, and Woody. Not much an be said about them though. The most notable out of all of them is definitely Akino the grandma who founded Aria Company and made the show a masterpiece in a few episodes she appeared in with great quotes and her own charisma. Later on in the series we also get to know her sweet story. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, the characters in Aria are pretty solid. The main trio creates this wonderful atmosphere of enjoying the present and becoming better with time while still accepting some losses in your life. Their teachers and the secondary characters also guide this show in a nice way with their interesting personalities and great memorable quotes. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aria is a great relaxing show to watch for all people who want to experience something genuine, kind, and a bit sci-fi. It is a show about a lot of things that can be memorable for quite a few different reasons. Many critics also consider it must-watch. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This show is full of interesting lore, great characters, wise quotes, beautiful scenery, and an atmosphere so unforgettable you may as well never find anything that compares to Aria in your entire life. It is a hidden gem for sure.

    <h2> 
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now, have you ever been to a village so small you may not even find it on any map, you city dweller? It is a rhetorical question so the answer does not really matter anyway. The real question is would you like to experience it? If so, this may be just the right show for you. Well, it’s not without flaws but overall still quite enjoyable. Let’s review it, shall we?
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/overview-image.jpeg" alt="" class="overview-image">
      <div class="image-subtitles">
        Nyanpasu? Is that what you came for?
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Setting
    </h2>
    <p> 
      As you may have guessed by the intro, this show is about a very small village. Well, there are also some cute girls living their lives to the fullest in spite of all the flaws of this place. Now, what makes it special? 
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, there are plenty of really good shots of the local scenery that is quite beautiful: mountains, forests, rivers - you’ve got it all in high quality! There are plenty of really quaint scenes of some really tiny objects like flowers that are drawn and animated so well you could place them in a museum. Makes you feel this place, doesn’t it? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, there are some details about the places these human beings find themselves living in. The school looks really old and not well taken care of with all the holes in the floor and the overall old look of the building. Some characters like Renge have really fancy traditional Japanese houses while other characters like Hotaru live in very modern ones. Quite the contrast, right? It does make it slightly more interesting.

    <h2>
      Plot
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, what kind of plot are you expecting from a relaxing show in the genre “cute girls doing cute things”? The plot is not the strongest point of this show and may even be summed up in a couple words but that is understandable because it is not what makes this show special. Come to think of, let’s sum it up in a couple words, now shall we?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our main girl - Hotaru - comes to this tiny village when her parents change their work for some reason. Then she gets introduced to all the local girls who accept her and they all end up having fun and just messing around. Award-winning plot, isn’t it? Just kidding. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The seasons change and you can see them doing different activities that may as well be very authentic in this village. Fishing, collecting plant sprouts, watching sakura bloom, creating snowmen - those are all the classic things the villagers do as seasons change. I would say that we do end up learning quite a bit about the way of life of people in this village. It may even be a documentary about a Japanese village at this point, you know?

    <h2>
      Characters 
    </h2>
    <p>
      You see, shows like these do depend a lot on the characters to thrive because there is nothing catchy otherwise. No blockbuster action, no thrilling plot. The characters are all there is. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I would say that the characters in this show are rather pathetic and one-dimensional even for kids their age. Their identities are not properly explored and their actions remain very predictable and boring. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotaru is just a cute city girl who is also secretly a lesbian in love with another girl. Like, if you are reading this and you are the creators of this show, let me ask you one thing: why in the world would you put obsessed lesbians in this childish show? Is fanservice really that important for such an innocent show? It does not really matter plot-wise if she is in fact a lesbian or not and the jokes just aren’t funny with her. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, just my personal issue. Let’s move on. We’ve got Natsumi the typical genki and Komari the typical tsundere that is also apparently really childish in her actions. What else? Oh yeah, Renge with her cringe worthy repetitive jokes that are just not funny. A great company, isn’t it? 
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve also got their brother who doesn’t say a word in the entire show, their irresponsible teacher who just carelessly sleeps all the time, Natsumi and Komari’s straight up psychopathic mom who beats them up like all good parents do, as well as some episodic characters like Renge’s cute friend Honoka, that kind of interesting woman responsible for their “candy shop”, whose name we never get to know, as well as Renge’s sister who was so boring I’ll have to look her name up. 10/10 characters all around, you agree? That candy shop woman’s relationship with Renge was quite wholesome though, not gonna lie.

    <h2>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, Non Non Biyori is an odd show for sure. On the one hand, you have all the beautiful scenery and profound traditions of this village. On the other hand, all the bad jokes and terrible, terrible characters. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You may still want to watch this show on a cozy summer afternoon though. Its atmosphere is indeed something to behold. However, don’t watch this show with enormous expectations or you will end up with that comedy gold face Renge made when she realized Honoka had left her. What a face, man…
